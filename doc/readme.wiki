= Name =

'''beanstalkd-nginx-module''' - An nginx module that talks to beanstalkd(a fast, general-purpose work queue). It supports put, reserve, delete, and many more beanstalkd commands.

''This module is not distributed with the Nginx source.'' See [[#Installation|the installation instructions]].

= Version =

This module is still under development, will be released soon.

= Synopsis =

<geshi lang="nginx">
    location /foo {
        set $job "hello";
        beanstalkd_query put 1 1 1 $job;
        beanstalkd_pass 127.0.0.1:11300;
    }
</geshi>

<geshi lang="nginx">
  http {
    ...
    upstream backend {
       server 127.0.0.1:11300;
       server 127.0.0.1:11301;
    }
    server {
        location /foo {
            set $cmd "put";
            set $dest "backend";
            beanstalkd_query $cmd 1 1 1 "hello";
            beanstalkd_pass $dest;
        }
        ...
    }
  }
  ...
</geshi>

= Description =

This module supports almost the whole [https://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/blob/master/doc/protocol.txt beanstalkd ascii protocol].

It allows you to define a custom [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST REST] interface to your beanstalkd servers or access beanstalkd in a very efficient way from within the nginx server.

This module is not supposed to be merged into the Nginx core because I've used [http://www.complang.org/ragel/ Ragel] to generate the beanstalkd response parsers (in C) for joy :)
